# Rust Musictracker
A keyboard-centric [Music Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) written in Rust.

Created as an "impossible day" task--something that feels outside of my skillset for a day's work.
### Prompt:
> Can I make a music tracker synthesizer that responds to user keyboard input?
