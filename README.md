# Rust musictracker
A keyboard-centric [Music Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) written in Rust.

Created as an "impossible day" task--something that feels outside of my skillset for a day's work.
### Prompt:
> Can I make a music tracker synthesizer that responds to user keyboard input?

# Setup and Execution
1. Add a WAV file for each column to the path ```custom_assets/<file_name>.wav```.
2. Update ```src/main.rs``` to point to the prepared files on lines: 71, 76, and 81.
3. Run the application with ```cargo run```.
